1) Write a program that creates a table named “superbowl_stats” . The table
should have the same attributes as found in the filet, that is, the program should
read the first row of the file and construct a table creation statement. All
attributes, beside the primary key, can be of type varchar.

import psycopg2
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(user="valerie",
                                  password="2468",
                                  host="127.0.0.1",
                                  port="5432",
                                  database="sie555_2021")
except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
print("Database connected")
# exit()
try:
    cur = connection.cursor()
    create_newtable = """CREATE TABLE superbowl_data
                   (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                    Date DATE,
                    SB VARCHAR(20),
                    Winner VARCHAR(45),
                    Winner_Pts INTEGER,
                    Loser VARCHAR(45),
                    Loser_Pts INTEGER,
                    MVP VARCHAR(45)
                    );"""
    cur.execute(create_newtable)
    connection.commit()
    print("Table created successfully in PostgreSQL")
except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error while fetching data from PostgreSQL", error)
finally:
    # closing database connection
    if connection:
        cur.close()
        connection.close()
        print("PostgreSQL connection is closed")

2) The next function of the program should read each record in the file, create and
SQL insert statement and create a new tuple in Postgres.

import psycopg2
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(user="valerie",
                                  password="2468",
                                  host="127.0.0.1",
                                  port="5432",
                                  database="sie555_2021")
except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
print("Database connected")
# exit()
try:
    cur1 = connection.cursor()
    import csv
    with open('superbowl_data.csv', 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        next(reader)
        for row in reader:
            cur1.execute("""INSERT INTO superbowl_stats(ID, Date,SB, Winner, Winner_Pts, Loser, Loser_Pts, MVP) 
            VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)""",
            row)
    connection.commit()
except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error while fetching data from PostgreSQL", error)
finally:
    # closing database connection
    if connection:
        cur1.close()
        connection.close()
        print("PostgreSQL connection is closed")

3) Write a first query statement that selects all records in the table and displays the
tuples, and a second query that find the team that won the Superbowl the most
often.

import psycopg2
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(user="valerie",
                                  password="2468",
                                  host="127.0.0.1",
                                  port="5432",
                                  database="sie555_2021")
except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
print("Database connected")
# exit()
try:
    cur = connection.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT * from superbowl_stats")
    rows = cur.fetchall()
    header = ['ID', 'Date', 'SB', 'Winner', 'Winner_Pts', 'Loser', 'Loser_pts', 'MVP']
    print("\nHere is the superbowl table:\n")
    print(header)
    for row in rows:
        print(row)
finally:
    # closing database connection
    if connection:
        cur.close()
        connection.close()
        print("PostgreSQL connection is closed")


import psycopg2
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(user="valerie",
                                  password="2468",
                                  host="127.0.0.1",
                                  port="5432",
                                  database="sie555_2021")
except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
print("Database connected")
# exit()
try:
    cur3 = connection.cursor()
    cur3.execute("""SELECT winner, totalpts FROM (SELECT winner, SUM(winner_pts) AS totalpts FROM superbowl_stats
                  GROUP BY winner) AS T  WHERE  totalpts=(SELECT MAX(totalpts) FROM (SELECT winner, SUM(winner_pts)
                  AS totalpts FROM superbowl_stats GROUP BY winner) AS T)""")
    result = cur3.fetchall()
    print("\nThe team that won the most often\n")
    for row in result:
        print(row)
finally:
    # closing database connection
    if connection:
        cur3.close()
        connection.close()
        print("PostgreSQL connection is closed")
